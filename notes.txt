"Your goal is to evaluate Logical Equivalence, not Textual Similarity. 
The reference_solution is a logical guide. If the student uses a different approach (e.g., a while loop instead of a for loop, 
or different variable names) but the result and logic are correct according to the rubric, do not deduct points. 
Only deduct points if there is a functional error or a violation of the explicit_instructions."
